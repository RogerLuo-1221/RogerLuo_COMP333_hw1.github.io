# RogerLuo_COMP333_hw1.github.io

The zip contains the HW_1 of COMP333 completed by Roger Luo. The files contain 1 html file, 1 css file, and 4 jpg files.
Though the assignemnt doucment mentioned that we should submit at least 2 html files, I still don't understand why is that necessary to contain 2 html files for making a landing page. When I checked the sources of other landing page website examples given by professor, they all contains only 1 html files.
